# NES Simulator

This is a personnel study project. Following OneLoneCoder's [tutorial](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcNES). And here's his YouTube channel: [javidx9](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-yuWVUplUJZvieEligKBkA).

The simulator is written in modern C++. This would be an interesting practice to refine C++ skill and get a deep understanding of computer principals.

## Demo

There is a little demo for processor 6502. It is based on [olcPixelGameEngine](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine) -- another project from OneLoneCoder. It could print out all registers, status flags, RAM and stack info. The demo is just a little program which calculates the product of 3 and 10.

## Tests

I collected some of the NES emulator tests from [NesDev community](https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Emulator_tests).
