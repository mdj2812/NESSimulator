# NES Simulator

This is a personnel study project. Following OneLoneCoder's [tutorial](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcNES). And here's his YouTube channel: [javidx9](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-yuWVUplUJZvieEligKBkA).

The simulator is written in modern C++. This would be an interesting practice to refine C++ skill and get a deep understanding of computer principals.

## Demo

There is a little demo for processor 6502. It is based on [olcPixelGameEngine](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine) -- another project from OneLoneCoder. On the right side, it prints out all registers, status flags and stack pointer. On the left side, it looks like an old fashioned TV with no-signal.

## Tests

I collected some of the NES emulator tests from [NesDev community](https://wiki.nesdev.com/w/index.php/Emulator_tests).
